# 3018
I bought the 3018 CNC as a cheap DIY kit and built it live on YouTube at the links below.  This repo is where I am storing all the information, guides, tutorials, parts and supplies  use in this build.
I have linked the exact parts and supplies you will see in upcoming videos on the main channel. So far it seems to be a great kit.  I am totally new to CNC but have 3D Printing and laser cutting experience.

### NOOBs Guide To First Cuts 

1.  CAM software is needed to generate the GCODE - Fusion 360 is what I have already in use for 3D Printing 
2. Connect Candle to the CNC and type $$ in to console- save this output as a backup file for initial config 


### Guidlines and definitions from Facebook group docs (not mine) 


$0=10 Step pulse, microseconds 3-15 ish (only the 15 is ish)

$1=25 Step idle delay, milliseconds 15-30 ish OR 255

$2=0 Step port invert, mask Only 0-7

$3=2 Direction port invert, mask Only 0-7

$4=0 Step enable invert, boolean Only 0 or 1

$5=0 Limit pins invert, boolean Only 0 or 1

$6=0 Probe pin invert, boolean Only 0 or 1

$10=1 Status report, mask Only 0-3

$11=0.010 Junction deviation, mm 0.1 to 0.001 ish

$12=0.002 Arc tolerance, mm 0.1 to 0.001 ish

$13=0 Report inches, boolean Only 0 or 1

$20=0 Soft limits, boolean Only 0 or 1

$21=0 Hard limits, boolean Only 0 or 1

$22=0 Homing cycle, boolean Only 0 or 1

$23=0 Homing dir invert, mask Only 0-7

$24=25.000 Homing feed, mm/min 10-50 ish

$25=500.000 Homing seek, mm/min 250-750 ish

$26=250 Homing debounce, milliseconds 5-50 ish Yes I know my default setting is wrong but it is not used.

$27=1.000 Homing pull-off, mm 0.5-3.5 ish

$30=1000 Max spindle speed, RPM 750-7500 ish

$31=0 Min spindle speed, RPM 0-100 ish

$32=0 Laser mode, boolean 0 or 1 1 ONLY when using a laser

$100=800.000 X steps/mm 800 or 1600*

$101=800.000 Y steps/mm 800 or 1600*

$102=800.000 Z steps/mm 800 or 1600*

$110=1000.000 X Max rate, mm/min 500-2000 ish

$111=1000.000 Y Max rate, mm/min 500-2000 ish

$112=600.000 Z Max rate, mm/min 500-2000 ish

$120=30.000 X Acceleration, mm/sec^2 20-10000 ish

$121=30.000 Y Acceleration, mm/sec^2 20-10000 ish

$122=30.000 Z Acceleration, mm/sec^2 20-10000 ish

$130=200.000 X Max travel, mm Around your router size ish

$131=200.000 Y Max travel, mm Around your router size ish

$132=200.000 Z Max travel, mm Around your router size ish

*
These values ($100-102) should all be the same. If only 2 are the same set the third accordingly. Other values are possible 
but 800 or 1600 are overwhelmingly common for this sort of router. However the tests you are going to run check these 
settings.
